Notice:
(1)The MiniGUI application could not exit normally, please press Ctrl+C to quit.
   Because we don't implement the mouse " right key" function, minigui could not call 
   the pop-up menu to exit. 
(2)The MiniGUI windows could not be drag and drop.
(3)The MiniGUI version we use is 1.3.0 , and configued to minigui-thread. 
(4)The speed MiniGUI running on SkyEye is slow. We will optimize it for high speed.
